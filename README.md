### Hi there <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I am Jennifer Echenim!

![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/Jennie_von?style=social)

A Frontend Engineer specialising in JavaScript technologies. Professional experience, with the technologies, listed in the toolbox below.

I am starting out my technical writing journey (*under my breath*-"wish me luck" ðŸ¤ž) about Web Development, JavaScript but I will also write about topics other than these, like how to balance life outside these two and more!

I have managed to create an online presence with my <a href="https://www.jennievon.dev">Blog</a>
